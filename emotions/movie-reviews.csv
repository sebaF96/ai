reviews
Excellent movie. The acting was great and it is very well directed.
A bit boring at first but enjoyable.
Very boring. You cant tell it has a low budget.
I loved it! Best movie of the year!
The special effects looked cheap and the plot is a bit slow.
The actors did a good job but the script is terrible.
Boring. So boring. 
Not the worst movie I've seen 
A waste of time
